\section{Domain Platform Evaluation}
\label{sec:EvaOp}

To set the stage for domain exploration,
this sections introduces the
target platform in~\secref{sec:Platform}, \newtext{and discusses two evaluation approaches to assess the benefit of a platform for a set of applications: Analytic Evaluation (AE)} in~\secref{sec:Ana} and Domain Score (DS) in~\secref{sec:ds}. ~\secref{sec:eva:sum} \newtext{compares both evaluation options in their speed accuracy trade-off.}

\subsection{Trade-off: Evaluation Speed / Accuracy }
\label{sec:eva:sum}

To compare the the evaluation approaches in terms of accuracy and speed, we analyze them for a set of 40 real vision applications on 100 different platforms (with the same HW budget=5) against execution on a cycle-approximate TLM. % please name the few
\tabref{tab:fidelity} illustrates the trade-off looking at fidelity instead of accuracy as the evaluation approaches are compare design alternatives. TLM is defined as 100\% fidelity for this comparison.

\end{table} 

Fidelity drops with abstraction: AE with 95.68\% and DS with 89.07\%. At the same time, abstraction yields dramatic speedups of 6 orders of magnitude from TLM to AE and another order of magnitude to DS. When evaluating a whole domain, DS is even 3 orders of magnitude faster than AE (assuming 100 apps in the domain) due to inherently incorporating all applications. In result, DS is preferred for rapid analysis, whereas the AE if more accuracy is needed. TLM simulation is too slow for DS-DSE.
