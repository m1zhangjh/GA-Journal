\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:results}


This section evaluates the benefits and costs of DSS and \ga from different angles. After defining the experimental setup, it first looks at a global comparison. It then gives insights to the individual variants, followed by analyzing the scalability with increasing domain size. Finally, it quantifies how well unknown applications can be supported.
